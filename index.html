<h1>Privacy Policy – 729 App</h1>

This Privacy Policy explains how user data is processed and what data protection rights you have when you use the 729 app (hereinafter referred to only as the app).

 

<h2>Controller and Contact Details</h2>
For the purposes of data protection, Robin Steinwarz is Controller (Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR).

If you need to contact us in connection with our use or processing of your personal data, or to gain access to it, please contact: 

Robin Steinwarz

Speckelsteinstraße 63,
53881 Euskirchen

E-Mail: robin.steinwarz.dp@gmail.com

(hereinafter referred to as Controller)

 

<h2>Purposes of Data Processing and Legal Bases for Processing</h2>
The app is programmed to process as little personal data as possible. The app itself can therefore be used without processing of personal data. In particular, the user can use the app without signing up for an account. Any data the user enters into the app is stored only locally on the mobile device and is not transmitted to the Controller.

When using the above contact options, the Controller will use the personal data from the query in order to process it. The legal basis for this data processing is then Art. 6 para. 1 lit b. GDPR or, as far as legal obligations related to business communication are concerned, the legal basis for further storage is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. The personal data that you provide to the Controller as part of this contact request will only be used to respond to the request or contact and for associated technical processes. This data processing is thereby regularly accompanied by a legitimate interest of the Controller in an appropriate processing of requests within the scope of his business management (cf. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR).

<p>The app itself does not collect personal data for Google. However, the Google Play Store may collect data during the download and installation process. For details, please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>Advertising and Third-Party Services</h3>
The app uses advertising services provided by IronSource (a Unity company) to display ads. These services may collect and process certain data from your device to provide advertisements, prevent fraud, measure ad performance, and optimize ad delivery.

Collected data may include:
<ul>
  <li>Advertising ID (AAID)</li>
  <li>Approximate location (based on IP address)</li>
  <li>Device information (model, OS version, language settings)</li>
  <li>Interaction data with the displayed ads</li>
</ul>

For more information about how IronSource handles user data, please refer to their Privacy Policy:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developers.is.com/ironsource-mobile/air/ironsource-mobile-privacy-policy/">IronSource Privacy Policy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the European Union and other regions with applicable data protection laws, users will be asked for consent regarding the use of their data for personalized advertising when launching the app. If consent is not given, only non-personalized ads will be shown. Consent can be managed via the app's consent prompt or through the device settings.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
This app is designed to be enjoyable for users of all ages. However, we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required by local law). 

The advertising services we use, such as IronSource, are configured to deliver only contextual, non-personalized ads to users who are identified as children under applicable laws.

If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us at the address provided above. We will take steps to delete such information from our systems if applicable.

<h2>Who Receives Your Personal Data?</h2>
The Controller does not share any user data directly with third parties. However, third-party services integrated into the app, such as IronSource, may collect data as described above.


<h2>Will Your Data be Transferred to Countries Outside the EU?</h2>
<p>The Controller does not transfer personal data directly to any entity outside the European Union or the European Economic Area. However, third-party services used in the app (such as IronSource) may transfer data globally in accordance with their own privacy policies.</p>

 

<h2>Retention Period</h2>
The app does not require the processing of personal data. Should the user nevertheless save personal data by means of the app, this will not be transmitted to the Controller. This data is only stored on the mobile device in a local storage. The deletion of any personal data within the app is therefore the responsibility of the user.

 

<h2>Automated Decision-Making</h2>
Automated decision-making (Art. 22 GDPR) does not take place.

 
<h2>Your Rights in Relation to Your Personal Data</h2>
You or the users of the app have the right to exercise the following rights with regard to personal data processed by the Controller:

The right of access to personal data concerning you, as well as the right to rectification or erasure or to restriction of processing or a right to object to processing, as well as the right to data portability.
Insofar as the data processing is based on consent, you have the right to revoke this consent at any time with effect for the future without affecting the lawfulness of the processing carried out based on the consent up to the revocation.
You or the users have the right to complain to a supervisory authority for data protection.
 
Please note that the aforementioned data protection rights can generally only be fulfilled by the Controller if the data to which the asserted claims relate can be clearly assigned to a user. Since the app processes as little personal data as possible in accordance with the principle of data minimization, an allocation will regularly be difficult to achieve. You are therefore advised pursuant to Art. 11 (2) GDPR that the Controller is generally not in a position to identify a user of the app and is also not obligated to do so pursuant to Art. 11 (2) sentence 2 GDPR in these cases.  Therefore, the aforementioned data protection rights will usually not be fulfilled by the Controller even if any additional information are provided regarding your identity.


<h2>Provision of Personal Data</h2>
Within the scope of using the app, you are neither legally nor contractually obligated to provide personal data to the Controller, and the provision of personal data is also not required for a possible conclusion of a contract (see above).

 
<h2>App Permissions</h2>
The app requires access to specific functions and interfaces of your smartphone or mobile device in order to provide the full range of functions. For this purpose, it is necessary that you grant certain permissions to the app.

The app requires the following permission(s):
<ul>
  <li>Internet – Required to load ads from IronSource servers.</li>
</ul>
