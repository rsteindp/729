(hereinafter referred to as Controller)
<p></p>

<b>Privacy Policy: 729 App</b><br>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy explains how user data is processed and what data protection rights you have when you use our app 729 
  (hereinafter referred to only as the app).
</p>

<p>
  Please carefully read this privacy policy. Your act of clicking to agree with 
  this privacy policy indicates your acceptance to our rules and policies concerning your personal data. As stated in this privacy policy, you 
  are not to use our service if you do not agree with this privacy policy.
</p>

<b>Privacy Updates:</b><br>
<p>
  We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time in order to provide you with better service. 
  We will notify users on this page or possibly in this application and/or by any available means where technically and legally feasible. 
  It is strongly recommended that you check this page frequently and refer to the last modification date listed in this privacy policy.
</p>

<b>Purposes of Data Processing and Legal Bases for Processing</b>
<p>
  The app is programmed to process as little personal data as possible. The app itself can therefore be used without processing of personal data.
  In particular, the user can use the app without signing up for an account. 
  Any data the user enters into the app is not transmitted to the Controller.
</p>

<p>
  When using the above contact options, the Controller will use the personal data from the query in order to process it. 
  The legal basis for this data processing is then Art. 6 para. 1 lit b. GDPR or, as far as legal obligations related to business communication are concerned, 
  the legal basis for further storage is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. 
  The personal data that you provide to the Controller as part of this contact request will only be used to respond to the request or contact and for associated technical processes. 
  This data processing is thereby regularly accompanied by a legitimate interest of the Controller in an appropriate processing 
  of requests within the scope of his business management (cf. Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR).
</p>

<p>
  The app itself does not collect personal data for Google. However, the Google Play Store may collect data during the download and installation process. 
  For details, please refer to Google’s Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
</p>

<b>Advertising and Third-Party Services</b>
<p>
  The app uses advertising services provided by IronSource (a Unity company) to display ads. 
  These services may collect and process certain data from your device to provide advertisements, prevent fraud, measure ad performance, and optimize ad delivery.
</p>
<p>
  The legal basis for processing personal data for personalized advertising is your explicit consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.
</p>

For more information about how IronSource handles user data, please refer to their Privacy Policy:
<a href="https://developers.is.com/ironsource-mobile/air/ironsource-mobile-privacy-policy/">IronSource Privacy Policy</a>

<b>Consent Management</b>
<p>
  The app includes a consent management feature in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive. 
  Upon first launch, you are asked whether you agree to the processing of your data for personalized advertising by third-party services such as IronSource. 
  No personal data is processed for advertising purposes until you provide your consent.
</p>

<b>Who Receives Your Personal Data?</b>
<p>
  The Controller does not share any user data directly with third parties. 
  However, third-party services integrated into the app, such as IronSource, may collect data.
</p>

<b>Will Your Data be Transferred to Countries Outside the EU?</b>
<p>
  The Controller does not transfer personal data directly to any entity outside the European Union or the European Economic Area. 
  However, third-party services used in the app (such as IronSource) may transfer data globally in accordance with their own privacy policies.
</p>

<b>Retention Period</b>
<p>
  The app itself does not collect or store any personal data on external servers. Any data entered by the user is saved locally on the user's 
  device and can be deleted by the user at any time by clearing the app’s storage or uninstalling the app.
</p>
<p>
  Third-party services integrated into the app (such as IronSource) may collect and retain certain personal data (e.g., advertising ID, device
  information, or usage data) in accordance with their own privacy policies and legal obligations. The Controller does not have access to, or 
  control over, the data retained by these services.
</p>
<p>
  You can manage or reset your Advertising ID, limit ad tracking, or withdraw consent at any time via your device settings.
</p>
<p>
  For detailed information on data retention by third-party providers, please refer to their respective privacy policies.
</p>

<b>Children's Privacy</b>
<p>
  This app is designed to be enjoyable for users of all ages. 
  However, we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required by local law). 
  The advertising services we use, such as IronSource, are configured to deliver only contextual, 
  non-personalized ads to users who are identified as children under applicable laws.
</p>

<b>Your Rights in Relation to Your Personal Data</b>
<p>
  You or the users of the app have the right to exercise the following rights with regard to personal data processed by the Controller:
</p>
<p>
  The right of access to personal data concerning you, as well as the right to rectification or erasure or to restriction of processing or 
  a right to object to processing, as well as the right to data portability.
  Insofar as the data processing is based on consent, you have the right to revoke this consent at any time with effect for the future without 
  affecting the lawfulness of the processing carried out based on the consent up to the revocation.
  You or the users have the right to complain to a supervisory authority for data protection. Please note that the aforementioned data protection rights 
  can generally only be fulfilled by the Controller if the data to which the asserted claims relate can be clearly assigned to a user. 
  Since the app processes as little personal data as possible in accordance with the principle of data minimization, an allocation will regularly 
  be difficult to achieve. You are therefore advised pursuant to Art. 11 (2) GDPR that the Controller is generally not in a position to identify 
  a user of the app and is also not obligated to do so pursuant to Art. 11 (2) sentence 2 GDPR in these cases.  Therefore, the aforementioned data 
  protection rights will usually not be fulfilled by the Controller even if any additional information are provided regarding your identity.
</p>
<p>
  Within the scope of using the app, you are neither legally nor contractually obligated to provide personal data to the Controller, 
  and the provision of personal data is also not required for a possible conclusion of a contract (see above).
</p>

<b>Automated Decision-Making</b>
<p>
  Automated decision-making (Art. 22 GDPR) does not take place.
</p>

<b>App Permissions</b>
<p>
  The app requires access to specific functions and interfaces of your smartphone or mobile device in order to provide the full range of functions.
